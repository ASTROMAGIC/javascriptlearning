// loop from 10 down to 0. We've provided you with aninitializer - let i = 10;

// the goal of this learning eexercise is to print out a simple luanch countdown to the output box, from 10 down to blastoff. 



// remember the 3 parts of a loop: initializer, condition, and iteration

    console.log(i);

    if (i === 0) {
        console.log("Blast Off!");
