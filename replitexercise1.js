function troubleshooting() {
	const a = 1;
	const b = 1;

	let result;

	// Edit between these lines
	// =================================
	result = a + b;

	// =================================

	return result;
}


// initially i believe this is equal to 0 because the value of both of these strings is 0 and in essence i'm adding two strings that have no value assigned to them, despite creating two variables with the numeric value of 1. 

// if i remove the quotes from a and b, they will be variables and and will likely give me the correct result. 

// ok that did not work and i'm not sure why. i think i'll google search this and look deeper into how operators work.

// so it turns out i was right and that code=0 means the code return without errors.
