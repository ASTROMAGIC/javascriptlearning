// write a simple loop that goes through all the items in an array and prints them out on the screen inside list items. 

const cars = ["Supra", "M240i", "Z8", "Type-R", "Lotus"];



for (const car of cars) {
    console.log(car);
}

// this is the simplest way of writing, I just need to see how it would work being attached to the list item as described by the assignment. Will open a new project to do this correctly and see it in action
