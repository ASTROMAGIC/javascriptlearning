// if i type it myself, the code appears with no errors but if i copy it from somewhere else the code might not work. Probably a formatting issue. I need to become more familiar with how functions and conditionals are supposed to work 

// these things are only going to get get bigger and more complicated. But as far as I can read, this function is just a numerical verifier. From what I previously learned, as long as the number is the same type, this should return true. 

// there isn't much more i can do with this file in this form, but i do need to figure out how to read the outputs of these exercises in the output viewer. might be some for some googling.
